# NotetakR
Take notes and transcribe text from images with your android phone's  
camera. This project was created at HackISU by Talen Fisher, Ty Trinh 
and Hung Truong

## Inspiration
Having to manually transcribe notes from a PowerPoint presentation or whiteboard can be cumbersome.  So we built an app to do it for us!

## What it does
Transcribes text from images taken with your android phone's camera and exports to Google Drive, email, and more!  If the text recognition didn't work perfectly, NotetakR provides an editor for making corrections.  

## How we built it
We built Notetakr using Android Studio, Java and Google's Firebase TextRecognition API.  

## Challenges we ran into
The CameraKit library we use for embedding the camera into our app's layout is experimental and not well documented, making the learning process hard.  Inexperience with creating android applications also set us back a few hours.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We made a completely functional android app that can be used in our everyday lives.  Learning about Android application development was also very rewarding! 

## What's next for Notetakr
* Google Play Store publication!
* Improved CameraKit functionality or direct use of the Camera2 Android API
* Cloud-based transcription storage
* UI Improvements
* Real-time/continuous transcription
* Date/Event extraction
* Our own text recognition ML algorithm that learns based on user edits
* iOS Port
